### This was my final project for my data visualization class. This project allows for the exploration of population trends throughout the major US metropolitan areas over the past decade. The creation of this project allowed me to use a variety of tool including MySQL, Python, Flask, HTML, jQuery and Plotly. Great care was taken to push as much of the work as possible to the front end, to alleviate any bottle-necking.
